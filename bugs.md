TODOs:

  - [ ] Write policy network to evaluate board values
  - [ ] Agents to play against
    - [x] Random
    - [ ] Greedy (minmax depth 1-5?)
      - [ ] alpha/beta pruning
    - [ ] NNs with X parameters & Y compute-hours

- [ ] More GUIs everywhere
- [ ] Export game to GPT and save for later model use

- [ ] Play game against self to generate game file
